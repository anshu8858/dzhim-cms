--------------------------------

## How did it start?

This was my free time fun project, created on **2013**, while I was working at [Mediaparks](http://mediaparks.lv).
At that time I worked daily with their in-house framework / CMS, called InSite. Like every project, it had it's 
flaws and awesome parts. So my goal was to create a framework / CMS that would contain the good parts and avoid
the bad parts from the InSite. It was created completely from scratch and no code was used from the existing
codebase, only principles. It was never meant to be published, only used for my own needs.

#### What was the goal?

Create a CMS / Framework, that could help me create websites more easily. The main requirement was reusable, easily customizable modules.

## Current status

I was working on it for few months and then just dropped it. On Feb 2018 I took it out from the dust, cleaned it up a bit,
added some docs and that's about it.
Currently, I doubt that I am willing to invest any time in it anymore, but, well, who knows, right?
